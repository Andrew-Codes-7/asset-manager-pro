<h1>Overview</h1>
Asset Manager Pro is a CRUD web appplication in python that I use in my current role as a warehouse and inventory manager to keep track of, and manage, our assets. The main areas that we need to monitor are vehicles, job materials, and tools and equipment. AMP allows for the creation of employees and assignment of those employees to vehicles, or equipment and tools to employees.
